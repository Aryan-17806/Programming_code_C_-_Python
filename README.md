#Create all_operation_in_array.c

This C program performs various operations on an NxN 2D array, including:

âœ… Searching for an element (displays 1-based index)

âœ… Swapping two elements (user provides 1-based indices)

âœ… Updating an element at a given position

âœ… Printing the array in normal and reverse order

âœ… Finding duplicate elements in the array

âœ… Finding the maximum and minimum values

ðŸ’¡ Key Features:

ðŸ”¹ 1-based indexing for user inputs & output (internally still 0-based for efficiency).

ðŸ”¹ Dynamic memory allocation for flexibility.

ðŸ”¹ Modular approach using functions for better code structure.


This program enhances user experience by aligning index representation with real-world numbering while keeping the internal logic optimized for C's array handling. ðŸš€ðŸ”¥
